      "My wife and I sat down and looked this over for a little while.  She loves playing \"Words with Friends\" on her phone and she had some good ideas about how to interpret the symbols for the smaller words.  It looks to me that this note might be a poem, judging by the periodic sentences, plus what might be the author's name appended at the very end.  After an hour we had not made much progress and so I decided to pursue a nerdy statistical approach.  This will be an interesting effort to work on during my free time over the holiday.\n",

      "The first step for me was to transcribe the indidual symbols in the message into a form amenable to manipulation by a machine.  I scanned thrugh the document and assigned a two-digit number to each symbol.  I wrote that all down on a piece paper while sitting on the couch.  Then I spent **way** too much time taking photos of those symbols and editing them into the image seen right below.\n",

Each line of numbers below corresponds to an individual word from the coded message.  I think it's a bit of a hassle at this point to worry about which words are placed on which line.  But the least I can do is keep track of index number for the first word on each line."
