She loves playing \"Words with Friends\" on her phone and she had some good ideas about how to interpret the symbols for the smaller words.  It looks to me that this note might be a poem, judging by the periodic sentences, plus what might be the author's name appended at the very end.  After an hour we had not made much progress and so I decided to pursue a nerdy statistical approach.  This will be an interesting effort to work on during my free time over the holiday."
